we are going to need a board to place the different moves.  We can do this  by creating lists with in list.  
We need 3 lists containig 3 other list each for a total of 9.  One list per position in th eboard.

We also need a user input from the users to place the Xs or the Os on the board.  
there will be 9 positions from 1 to 9
if the user enter anything else than 1 to 9 we will ask them to try again
we also need to be able to let the user quit the game

I need to check if the spot is already taken
